# hello-world
This is where I am learning how to use GitHub.
I'm considering using GitHub to manage my collaborative writing in Latex.

GitHub notes

1.	Set up an account.  I went for free and public…  Public?  Where are we going to store our data – these are sensitive things.
2.	I did the tutorial on making a subbranch and commiting changes to it.
3.	Now installing GitHub Desktop which I’m guessing allows access to GitHub without use of an internet browser.
